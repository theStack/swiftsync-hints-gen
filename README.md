## IBD Booster hints file generator

Tool to create a binary-encoded hints file for the "IBD Booster" proposal.

The resulting data is a bit-vector of all transaction outputs ever created
up to block number N, where each bit indicates the answer to the question
"Is this transaction output part of the UTXO set at block height N?".

The input UTXO set database for a certain snapshot at height N
can be generated by Bitcoin Core with the following commands:
``` 
$ ./build/bin/bitcoin-cli -rpcclienttimeout=0 -named dumptxoutset $PWD/utxos.dat rollback=N
$ ./contrib/utxo-tools/utxo_to_sqlite.py utxos.dat utxos.sqlite3
```

The hints data file can then be generated by running the script via uv as follows:
```
$ uv run booster-gen.py -v <bitcoin-datadir> utxos.sqlite3 ibd-booster.bin
```
Note that no Bitcoin Core instance should be running on the provided datadir, as otherwise the block data can't be accessed.
